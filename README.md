Object Detection

An object detection project involves training a machine learning model to recognize and locate various objects within images or video frames. This project typically includes gathering and labeling a dataset, training a model with popular algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), and evaluating the modelâ€™s accuracy. The goal is for the model to accurately detect and draw bounding boxes around objects in real-time or static images, identifying them with high precision. Object detection has applications in areas like security surveillance, autonomous driving, and augmented reality.
